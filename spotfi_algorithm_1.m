%% Time of Flight (ToF) Sanitization Algorithm, find a linear fit for the unwrapped CSI phase
% csi_matrix -- the CSI matrix whose phase is to be adjusted
% delta_f    -- the difference in frequency between subcarriers
% Return:
% csi_matrix -- the same CSI matrix with modified phase
function [csi_matrix, phase_matrix] = spotfi_algorithm_1(csi_matrix, packet_one_phase_matrix)
    %% Time of Flight (ToF) Sanitization Algorithm
    %  Obtain a linear fit for the phase
    %  Using the expression:
    %      argmin{\rho} \sum_{m,n = 1}^{M, N} (\phi_{i}(m, n) 
    %          + 2 *\pi * f_{\delta} * (n - 1) * \rho + \beta)^2
    %
    %  Arguments:
    %  M is the number of antennas
    %  N is the number of subcarriers
    %  \phi_{i}(m, n) is the phase for the nth subcarrier, 
    %      on the mth antenna, for the ith packet
    %  f_{\delta} is the frequency difference between the adjacent
    %      subcarriers
    %  \rho and \beta are the linear fit variables
    %
